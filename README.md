Hello, 
I am Diego, but I am changing my name to Marvin Green. 
So if you could call Marvin instead of Diego, it would 
Be much appreciated. I am in the military and I will be 
getting out of the military in 2023. I live on the east 
coast. I am currently going to school at Bryan University 
and I am in their Web Development Program. I am married 
and have two Cats.
